OCUS.LY - Enhancing Focus and Reducing Stress for the Elderly
ðŸš€ Built at HackHarvard by a Team of 5

ðŸ”¹ Inspiration
OCUS.LY was born from a desire to improve focus and reduce stress in elderly individuals through technology. As people age, maintaining concentration and managing stress become increasingly challenging, affecting their overall well-being. Our goal was to combine technology with empathy to create a smart and intuitive platform that helps seniors stay focused and stress-free.

ðŸ”¹ What It Does
OCUS.LY leverages computer vision and biometric data to monitor focus levels and stress patterns in elderly users. The platform integrates with Terra-API to gather stress-related data and uses computer vision to track eye movements and blink rates, helping detect signs of drowsiness and loss of focus.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
âœ… Real-time Focus Tracking - Uses computer vision to monitor eye movements and blink patterns.
âœ… Stress Level Analysis - Gathers biometric data via Terra-API for personalized insights.
âœ… AI-Powered Music Recommendations - Curates binaural beats and calming music based on focus and stress levels.
âœ… User-Friendly Dashboard - Displays stress and focus data in an intuitive and accessible interface for seniors.

By integrating data-driven insights with personalized well-being solutions, OCUS.LY aims to empower the elderly with better focus and relaxation.

ðŸ”¹ How We Built It
Our team used a combination of AI, biometrics, and full-stack development to bring OCUS.LY to life:

ðŸ”¹ Frontend:

Next.js - Built a seamless and accessible user interface.
Firebase Authentication - Ensured secure logins for users.
ðŸ”¹ Backend & Data Processing:

Python & OpenCV - Implemented computer vision for focus tracking.
Terra-API Integration - Collected stress-related biometric data.
Flask API - Connected the Python-based focus detection to the Next.js frontend.
ðŸ”¹ Database & Storage:

Firebase Realtime Database - Stored user data and focus insights securely.
ðŸ”¹ AI & Well-Being Features:

Music Recommendation System - Based on focus and stress levels, users receive personalized binaural beats and music for relaxation.
ðŸ”¹ Challenges We Faced
Like any ambitious project, we encountered challenges along the way:

ðŸ›  Real-time Data Processing - Ensuring smooth, real-time updates without lag required extensive optimization.
ðŸ›  Computer Vision Complexity - Analyzing blink patterns and tracking focus accurately proved challenging.
ðŸ›  Integrating Python API with Next.js - Connecting our Flask-based focus detection model with Next.js took extra effort.
ðŸ›  Secure Data Handling - Since we worked with biometric and sensitive data, security was a top priority.

ðŸ”¹ Accomplishments Weâ€™re Proud Of
âœ… Successfully built a fully functional prototype at HackHarvard in a short timeframe.
âœ… Combined technology and compassion to create a meaningful solution for elderly well-being.
âœ… Developed an AI-powered system that accurately tracks focus and stress levels.
âœ… Created a personalized music therapy feature to improve relaxation and cognitive performance.
